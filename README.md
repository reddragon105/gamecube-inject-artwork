# gamecube-inject-artwork

A collection of icon and banner images for GameCube games for use with TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector.

I created these when going through my collection of GameCube games and injecting them into Wii U apps so that I could have them installed as channels on my Wii U's homescreen.
