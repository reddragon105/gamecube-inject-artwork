# What is this?

A collection of icon and banner images for GameCube games for use with TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector.

I created these when going through my collection of GameCube games and injecting them into Wii U apps so that I could have them installed as channels on my Wii U's homescreen.

I wanted to have the GameCube logo on the icons, so that the games were clearly identifiable as GameCube games amongst other types of game, such as Wii U, Wii, Virtual Console, etc., and I also wanted to have the GameCube bootup logo as the background when the game starts to load and you hear the bootup sound (it's just a shame it doesn't support video, otherwise I would have used the original bootup animation!). I also edited the bootup sound so that it gets louder at the end in an attempt to counter the fade out that the Wii U automatically applies because I felt like it was getting cut off too soon.

For the banners, I've mostly used the same screenshots of the main menu that cucholix did in the original repo, so full credit goes to them for that - I've just changed the background and tweaked the text in some cases.
For the icons, I've used the box cover art for each game, which has been edited to fit the different aspect ratio as much as possible, although in some cases it might be noticeably stretched.

# What's included?

Artwork for every game that I've installed on my Wii U. You can go down the list and see if the game you want is there and, if you like it, you can just use it as-is.

Otherwise, there are Photoshop templates for icons and banners so you can just download the PSDs and edit them yourself, adding artwork for whichever game(s). If you're doing this, make sure you also download and install the fonts.

Also there's my edited bootsound_gc_nofade.wav, in case anyone wants that.

# How do I use it?

When injecting a game with TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector you can set the artwork on the first tab, 'Required Source Files'. Click 'Icon' and set the icon image; click 'Banner' and set the banner image. Previews will be shown. The bootsound is added under the second tab, 'Optional Source Files'.

# Credits

Lots of credit goes to cucholix for making the templates and files in the original repo because everything here is inspired by and based on that.

And a shoutout goes to TeconMoon for the awesome WiiVC Injector that makes this possible.
